# Worklet

A powerful tool for creating isolated development environments. Fork your repository, test changes in Docker containers, and seamlessly integrate results back into your Git workflow.

## Why Worklet?

- **Isolated Testing**: Test changes without affecting your main repository
- **Docker-in-Docker**: Run complex Docker workflows in complete isolation
- **Git Integration**: Commit and push changes directly from forks
- **Service Exposure**: Access your services via unique URLs with built-in reverse proxy
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Fast Switching**: Jump between different test environments instantly

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install worklet
go install github.com/nolanleung/worklet@latest

# Initialize configuration  
worklet init

# Fork your current repository
worklet fork

# Switch to the fork and run in Docker
worklet switch 1

# You're now in an isolated Docker environment!
# Make changes, run tests, experiment freely

# When done, commit and push your changes with one command
worklet commit -a -b feature/tested-change -m "Tested feature" --push
```

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
go install github.com/nolanleung/worklet@latest
```

### Manual Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nolanleung/worklet
cd worklet
go build -o worklet .
sudo mv worklet /usr/local/bin/
```

## Features

### üöÄ **Instant Isolated Environments**
Create a complete copy of your repository with one command. Each fork is isolated, allowing you to experiment without fear.

### üê≥ **True Docker-in-Docker Support**
- **Full isolation mode** (default): Runs a separate Docker daemon inside the container
- **Shared mode**: Uses host Docker daemon for resource efficiency
- Perfect for testing Docker Compose setups, building images, or running containerized tests

### üìä **Visual Progress Tracking**
Watch your fork creation progress with a real-time progress bar showing files copied and size.

### üîß **Comprehensive Fork Management**
- List all forks with sizes and creation times
- Remove specific forks or clean up old ones
- Switch between forks instantly
- Monitor disk usage easily

### üìù **Git Workflow Integration**
Forks include the complete `.git` directory, enabling you to:
- Create feature branches from experimental work
- Commit changes made during testing
- Push directly to remote repositories
- Maintain full Git history

### üîå **Self-Contained Binary**
The worklet binary includes all necessary scripts. No external dependencies beyond Docker.

### üöÄ **Init Scripts**
Run initialization commands automatically when containers start - perfect for installing dependencies, setting up tools, or configuring the environment.

### üåê **Service Exposure with Reverse Proxy**
Expose your services with unique, accessible URLs through the built-in nginx reverse proxy:
- Each service gets a unique URL like `api.x7k9m2p4.fork.local.worklet.sh`
- Automatic service registration when containers start
- Persistent mappings that survive proxy restarts
- Support for multiple services per fork
- WebSocket support included
- Clean URLs for easy sharing and testing
- Service URLs remain consistent for each fork

## Configuration

Create a `.worklet.jsonc` file in your repository root:

```jsonc
{
  "fork": {
    "name": "my-project",
    "description": "Testing new features",
    "includeGit": true,     // Include .git directory (default: true)
    "exclude": [            // Patterns to exclude from fork
      "node_modules",
      "*.log",
      ".DS_Store",
      "dist",
      "build"
    ]
  },
  "run": {
    "image": "docker:dind",              // Docker image to use
    "isolation": "full",                 // "full" or "shared"
    "command": ["sh"],                   // Command to run
    "initScript": [                      // Commands to run on container start
      "apt-get update",
      "apt-get install -y nodejs npm",
      "npm install -g yarn"
    ],
    "environment": {                     // Environment variables
      "DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR": "",
      "DOCKER_DRIVER": "overlay2"
    },
    "volumes": [],                       // Additional volume mounts
    "privileged": true                   // Required for Docker-in-Docker
  },
  "services": [                          // Services to expose via reverse proxy
    {
      "name": "api",
      "port": 3000,                      // Port your service runs on
      "subdomain": "api"                 // Access at api.{random}.fork.local.worklet.sh
    },
    {
      "name": "frontend",
      "port": 8080,
      "subdomain": "app"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Commands

### `worklet init`
Initialize a new `.worklet.jsonc` configuration file.

```bash
worklet init                    # Create config with defaults
worklet init --minimal          # Create minimal config
worklet init --force            # Overwrite existing config
```

Creates a `.worklet.jsonc` configuration file with sensible defaults.

### `worklet fork`
Create a fork of the current repository.

```bash
worklet fork
# Output: Fork created at: /Users/you/.worklet/forks/fork-abc123
```

### `worklet run`
Run the current directory in a Docker container.

```bash
worklet run
# Starts Docker container with your configuration
```

### `worklet switch [fork]`
Switch to a fork and run it in Docker immediately.

```bash
worklet switch                  # Interactive selection
worklet switch 1                # By index (from list)
worklet switch fork-abc123      # By fork ID
worklet switch my-project       # By name
worklet switch --print-path 1   # Just print path (for scripts)
```

### `worklet list`
List all forks with details.

```bash
worklet list                    # Table view
worklet list --json            # JSON output
worklet list --verbose         # Detailed information
```

Example output:
```
FORK ID         NAME           CREATED        SIZE      SOURCE
fork-abc123     my-project     2 hours ago    125.3 MB  /Users/you/project
fork-def456     experiment     1 day ago      89.2 MB   /Users/you/project

Total: 2 forks (214.5 MB)
```

### `worklet remove [fork-ids...]`
Remove specific forks.

```bash
worklet remove fork-abc123              # Single fork
worklet remove fork-abc fork-def       # Multiple forks
worklet remove fork-abc123 --force     # Skip confirmation
```

### `worklet clean`
Clean up forks.

```bash
worklet clean                    # Remove all forks
worklet clean --older-than 7     # Remove forks older than 7 days
worklet clean --dry-run          # Preview what would be deleted
worklet clean --force            # Skip confirmation
```

### `worklet commit [fork]`
Commit changes in a worklet fork with Git operations.

```bash
worklet commit                           # Commit in current fork (interactive)
worklet commit -m "Fix bug"              # Commit with message
worklet commit 1 -m "Add feature"        # Commit in fork by index
worklet commit fork-abc123 -m "Update"   # Commit by fork ID
worklet commit -a -m "Fix all issues"    # Stage all changes and commit
worklet commit -b feature/new -m "Add"   # Create branch and commit
worklet commit -m "Complete" --push      # Commit and push to remote
```

Options:
- `-m, --message`: Commit message (prompts if not provided)
- `-a, --all`: Stage all changes before committing
- `-b, --branch`: Create and switch to new branch before committing
- `--push`: Push to remote after committing

Example workflow:
```bash
# After testing in a fork
$ worklet commit -a -b feature/tested -m "Tested feature implementation" --push
Current git status:
M  src/app.js
A  src/newfeature.js
Staging all changes...
Creating and switching to branch: feature/tested
Committing with message: Tested feature implementation
Pushing to origin/feature/tested...
Successfully committed changes in fork: /Users/you/.worklet/forks/fork-abc123
```

### `worklet link <tool>`
Link external tools to your worklet configuration.

Currently supported tools:
- `claude`: Links Claude Code authentication

```bash
worklet link claude             # Link Claude authentication
worklet link claude --force     # Force overwrite existing mounts
```

#### Linking Claude Code

The `worklet link claude` command adds a volume mount for your Claude authentication directory to the worklet configuration, allowing you to use Claude Code inside containers.

```bash
# Link Claude to your worklet
$ worklet link claude
Successfully linked Claude authentication to worklet configuration.
Added volume mount: /Users/you/.claude:/root/.claude:ro

# Now you can use Claude in your containers
$ worklet switch my-fork
/workspace # claude --help
/workspace # claude "explain this code"
```

This modifies your `.worklet.jsonc` to include:
```jsonc
{
  "run": {
    "volumes": [
      "/Users/you/.claude:/root/.claude:ro"
    ]
  }
}
```

### `worklet proxy`
Manage the nginx reverse proxy for service exposure. The proxy maintains persistent mappings of all registered services, storing them in `~/.worklet/proxy/mappings.json`. This means your service URLs remain consistent even after restarting the proxy or stopping containers.

```bash
worklet proxy start                  # Start the reverse proxy
worklet proxy stop                   # Stop the reverse proxy
worklet proxy status                  # Show proxy status and mappings
worklet proxy list                    # List all registered forks (including stopped ones)
worklet proxy logs                   # View nginx container logs
worklet proxy inspect                # Show detailed container info
worklet proxy register <fork-id>     # Manually register a fork
worklet proxy unregister <fork-id>   # Remove a fork registration

# All proxy commands support debug mode:
worklet proxy --debug start          # Show detailed debug logging
worklet proxy --debug list           # Debug why mappings aren't showing
```

### `worklet terminal`
Start a web-based terminal server for browser-based access to fork containers. The terminal server now includes full CORS support for cross-origin requests.

```bash
worklet terminal                     # Start on default port 8080
worklet terminal -p 3000            # Use custom port
worklet terminal -o=false           # Don't auto-open browser
worklet terminal --cors-origin="https://myapp.com"  # Set specific CORS origin
worklet terminal --cors-origin="*"   # Allow all origins (default)
```

#### Starting the Proxy

The proxy server runs an nginx container that routes traffic to your fork services:

```bash
$ worklet proxy start
Proxy started successfully
Services will be available at: http://{service}.{random}.fork.local.worklet.sh
```

#### Checking Proxy Status

View the current proxy status and all active service mappings:

```bash
$ worklet proxy status
Proxy Status: Running
Health Check: OK

Active Fork Mappings:

Fork: fork-abc123
  api: http://api.x7k9m2p4.fork.local.worklet.sh (container: worklet-fork-abc123-api, port: 3000)
  frontend: http://app.x7k9m2p4.fork.local.worklet.sh (container: worklet-fork-abc123-frontend, port: 8080)
```

#### Manual Fork Registration

You can manually register forks with the proxy without running them through worklet:

```bash
# Register with explicit services
$ worklet proxy register my-app --service api:3000:api --service web:8080:app

Fork 'my-app' registered successfully!

Proxy URLs:
  api: http://api.abc123xy.fork.local.worklet.sh (port 3000)
  web: http://app.abc123xy.fork.local.worklet.sh (port 8080)

# Register using services from .worklet.jsonc in current directory
$ worklet proxy register my-app --from-config

# Unregister when done
$ worklet proxy unregister my-app
Fork 'my-app' unregistered successfully
```

This is useful when:
- Running services outside of worklet but want to use the proxy
- Testing services in existing containers
- Integrating with other tools that manage containers

#### Listing Registered Forks

View all forks registered with the proxy. Thanks to persistent storage, this command shows all registered forks even if their containers are stopped or the proxy was restarted:

```bash
# Default table format - shows all persisted mappings
$ worklet proxy list
FORK ID         SERVICE         URL
--------------- --------------- --------------------------------------------------
my-app          api             http://api.x7k9m2p4.fork.local.worklet.sh
                web             http://app.x7k9m2p4.fork.local.worklet.sh
fork-abc123     frontend        http://app.y8n3k5q2.fork.local.worklet.sh
                backend         http://api.y8n3k5q2.fork.local.worklet.sh

Total: 2 forks, 4 services

# JSON format for scripting
$ worklet proxy list --json
{
  "forks": [
    {
      "id": "my-app",
      "host": "x7k9m2p4",
      "services": [...]
    }
  ],
  "total_forks": 2,
  "total_services": 4
}

# Verbose output with container details
$ worklet proxy list --verbose
```

Note: The proxy loads mappings from `~/.worklet/proxy/mappings.json`, so you'll see all registered services even if containers aren't currently running.

#### Automatic Registration

When you run a fork with services configured, they are automatically registered with the proxy:

```bash
$ worklet switch my-fork

Proxy URLs:
  api: http://api.x7k9m2p4.fork.local.worklet.sh
  frontend: http://app.x7k9m2p4.fork.local.worklet.sh

Running: docker run --rm -it --name worklet-fork-abc123-api ...
```

#### Persistence and Management

The proxy automatically persists all fork mappings to ensure consistency:

- **Storage Location**: Mappings are saved in `~/.worklet/proxy/mappings.json`
- **Automatic Saving**: Mappings are saved whenever forks are registered or unregistered
- **Consistent URLs**: Each fork keeps the same random host identifier across restarts
- **Persistence Benefits**:
  - View all services with `worklet proxy list` even when containers are stopped
  - Restart the proxy without losing service configurations
  - Share consistent URLs with team members
  
To reset all mappings and start fresh:
```bash
rm ~/.worklet/proxy/mappings.json
worklet proxy stop
worklet proxy start
```

## Workflows

### Testing a Risky Change

```bash
# 1. Fork your repository
$ worklet fork
Fork created at: /Users/you/.worklet/forks/fork-abc123

# 2. Switch to the fork (runs in Docker)
$ worklet switch fork-abc123
Starting Docker daemon in full isolation mode...

# 3. Make your risky changes
/workspace # rm -rf old-module/
/workspace # docker-compose up -d
/workspace # npm test

# 4. If successful, commit from the fork
/workspace # exit
$ worklet commit -a -b feature/remove-old-module -m "Removed old module, all tests pass" --push
```

### Testing Docker Compose Setups

```bash
# Your docker-compose.yml is completely isolated
$ worklet switch my-fork
/workspace # docker-compose up -d
/workspace # docker ps  # Only shows containers in this isolated environment
/workspace # docker-compose down
```

### Parallel Testing

```bash
# Fork multiple times for parallel experiments
$ worklet fork && worklet fork && worklet fork

# List your forks
$ worklet list
FORK ID         NAME           CREATED
fork-abc123     my-project     just now
fork-def456     my-project     just now  
fork-ghi789     my-project     just now

# Run different tests in each fork
$ worklet switch 1  # Test configuration A
$ worklet switch 2  # Test configuration B
$ worklet switch 3  # Test configuration C
```

### Using Init Scripts

Configure automatic dependency installation:

```jsonc
// .worklet.jsonc
{
  "run": {
    "image": "node:18",
    "initScript": [
      "npm install",                    // Install project dependencies
      "npm install -g typescript",      // Install global tools
      "npx playwright install"          // Set up test browsers
    ]
  }
}
```

Now when you run:
```bash
$ worklet switch my-fork
Running initialization script...
npm install
‚úì Dependencies installed
npm install -g typescript
‚úì TypeScript installed globally
npx playwright install
‚úì Playwright browsers installed

# Your environment is ready to use!
/workspace #
```

### Running a Multi-Service Application

Configure and run applications with multiple services that need to communicate:

```jsonc
// .worklet.jsonc
{
  "fork": {
    "name": "microservices-app"
  },
  "run": {
    "image": "node:18",
    "initScript": [
      "cd apps/api && npm install",
      "cd apps/frontend && npm install"
    ]
  },
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "api",
      "port": 3000,
      "subdomain": "api"
    },
    {
      "name": "frontend",
      "port": 8080,
      "subdomain": "app"
    },
    {
      "name": "admin",
      "port": 9000,
      "subdomain": "admin"
    }
  ]
}
```

Start the proxy and run your services:

```bash
# Start the proxy server (one time)
$ worklet proxy start
Proxy started successfully

# Fork and switch to your development environment
$ worklet fork
$ worklet switch 1

Proxy URLs:
  api: http://api.abc123xy.fork.local.worklet.sh
  frontend: http://app.abc123xy.fork.local.worklet.sh
  admin: http://admin.abc123xy.fork.local.worklet.sh

# Inside the container, start your services
/workspace # cd apps/api && npm start &
/workspace # cd apps/frontend && npm start &
/workspace # cd apps/admin && npm start &

# Your services are now accessible via their unique URLs!
# The frontend can call the API using its proxy URL
# Share the URLs with team members for testing
```

The proxy automatically:
- Routes requests to the correct container and port
- Supports WebSocket connections
- Handles multiple services per fork
- Cleans up when the container stops

## Custom Docker Images

Worklet supports custom Docker images for specialized development environments. We provide pre-built images with common tools:

### Docker Image with Claude Code

A Docker-in-Docker image with Claude Code pre-installed is available in `docker/with-claude-code/`.

```bash
# Build the image
cd docker/with-claude-code
./build.sh

# Or manually
docker build -t worklet/dind-claude-code:latest docker/with-claude-code/

# Use in your .worklet.jsonc
{
  "run": {
    "image": "worklet/dind-claude-code:latest"
  }
}
```

After building and configuring:
```bash
worklet link claude  # Link your Claude authentication
worklet switch my-fork
/workspace # claude --help  # Claude is pre-installed!
```

## Shell Integration

### Quick Fork Directory Access

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Change directory to a fork
wcd() {
    local path=$(worklet switch --print-path "$@")
    if [ $? -eq 0 ] && [ -n "$path" ]; then
        cd "$path"
        echo "Changed to: $path"
    fi
}

# List and cd to a fork
wl() {
    worklet list
    echo -n "Enter fork number: "
    read num
    wcd $num
}
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Use `worklet clean --older-than 7` weekly to manage disk space
2. **Naming Forks**: Use descriptive names in `.worklet.jsonc` for easier identification
3. **Git Strategy**: Create feature branches directly from forks after successful testing
4. **Disk Space**: Monitor with `worklet list` - fork sizes include the full `.git` directory
5. **Performance**: Exclude large directories (like `node_modules`) for faster forking

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Permission Denied
Ensure your user is in the docker group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in
```

### Fork Creation Fails
Check disk space and permissions:
```bash
df -h ~/.worklet
ls -la ~/.worklet/forks
```

### Docker-in-Docker Issues
Ensure you're using `"isolation": "full"` and `"privileged": true` in your configuration.

### Proxy Issues

#### Proxy fails to start
Ensure Docker is running and you have network permissions:
```bash
docker network ls  # Check Docker is accessible
docker ps          # Check for conflicting containers
```

If nginx container already exists:
```bash
docker stop worklet-nginx-proxy
docker rm worklet-nginx-proxy
worklet proxy start
```

#### Services not accessible
1. Check proxy is running:
   ```bash
   worklet proxy status
   ```

2. Ensure services are configured in `.worklet.jsonc`

3. Verify the container is connected to the worklet network:
   ```bash
   docker inspect <container-name> | grep NetworkMode
   ```

4. Check service is actually running inside container on the configured port

#### Network connectivity issues
The proxy requires:
- Docker network named `worklet-network` (created automatically)
- Port 80 available on your host machine
- Services running on the ports specified in configuration

#### Proxy mappings issues
If proxy mappings seem incorrect or outdated:
1. Check the mappings file:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.worklet/proxy/mappings.json
   ```

2. Reset all mappings if needed:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.worklet/proxy/mappings.json
   worklet proxy stop
   worklet proxy start
   ```

3. Verify mappings are loaded:
   ```bash
   worklet proxy list
   ```

#### Debugging proxy issues
Use the `--debug` flag to see detailed logging:
```bash
# Debug proxy startup issues
worklet proxy --debug start

# Debug why services aren't showing
worklet proxy --debug list

# Debug registration problems
worklet proxy --debug register my-fork --service api:3000:api
```

Debug output includes:
- Docker command execution details
- Network creation/verification steps
- Config file generation and paths
- Container startup and health checks
- Persistence file operations
- Error context and stack traces

## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or later (for building from source)
- Docker installed and running
- Sufficient disk space for forks
